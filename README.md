Hello! 👋 I'm Joe, a data science enthusiast with a particular passion for outlier detection and anomaly detection methods.

👀 Interests
I’m fascinated by the challenges and insights that come from outlier detection. Identifying unusual patterns in data can unveil critical insights for businesses, whether it's detecting fraudulent activity, unusual behaviors, or rare events that could impact decision-making. My current focus lies in building robust anomaly detection frameworks that can efficiently handle various types of data and adapt to new patterns.

🌱 Currently Learning
I’m in the process of building an anomaly detector that leverages embeddings and autoencoders. By using embeddings, I'm working to represent high-dimensional data in a way that captures its most important features, while autoencoders allow for efficient unsupervised learning by reconstructing inputs and identifying deviations. I’m exploring different architectures and optimization techniques to improve the model's accuracy and efficiency in real-world scenarios.

💞️ Collaboration
I'm always eager to collaborate, especially on projects in EdTech where data science can make a significant impact. I’m particularly interested in projects that focus on enhancing online learning platforms through data-driven insights—such as improving personalized learning experiences, detecting cheating, and supporting academic integrity.

⚡ Current Reading
Right now, I'm diving into Antifragile by Nassim Taleb. It’s a fascinating exploration of how systems can benefit from stressors, uncertainty, and disorder—a concept that is surprisingly relevant to data science. Taleb’s insights are helping me think more critically about resilience in models and how we can design algorithms that are not only robust but also adaptive to unexpected shifts in data.
